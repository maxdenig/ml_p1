## Machine Learning Project (Python)
## Max Reinheimer dos Santos Denig
 Project made in PyCharm.
 
 Python project consisting of designing a pipeline and use it to test models through benchmarks and get the best results we could solving the problem.
 
 The problem is a classification problem involving previous campaigns results and assessing the probability of next campaign working based on customer profile.
 
 The first step, before building the stepline, is feature exploration, done in the Feature_Exploration.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file.
